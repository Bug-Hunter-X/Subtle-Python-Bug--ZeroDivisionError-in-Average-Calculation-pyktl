This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Python: handling zero division errors when calculating the average of a list of numbers.  The `bug.py` file contains code with the error, while `bugSolution.py` shows the corrected version. The bug arises when calculating the average of an empty list or a list containing only zeros.  The solution involves a robust check for these situations to prevent a `ZeroDivisionError`.
